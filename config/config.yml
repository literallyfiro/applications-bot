        1. Fetch Current Training Data: This option will allow you to retrieve the current training data in a JSON file format. You can use this data to examine the current state of the bot's knowledge and make any necessary changes.

        2. Train Bot: This option will start the training process for the bot, allowing it to improve its language and conversation skills based on new data.

        Please select the option you would like to proceed with.
    training_first_phase: |
        üëã To commence our training process, I require three files.

        ‚Ä¢ Firstly, I need a substantial collection of diverse and legitimate words. It's preferable that the file is at least a few megabytes in size. However, please avoid selecting literature from science fiction and fantasy genres, as these often contain uncommon word formations. (ü§î For instance, the default model was trained using a Sherlock Holmes novel.) <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ImOnlyFire/applications-bot/main/gibberish/defaults/good.txt">Example</a>

        ‚Ä¢ Secondly, I need a file with around 20 simple and straightforward phrases that are easy to comprehend and free of complex language or unusual word formations. <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ImOnlyFire/applications-bot/main/gibberish/defaults/goodsm.txt">Example</a>

        ‚Ä¢ Finally, I need a file filled with overtly bad words and gibberish. This file will assist our AI model in learning what constitutes gibberish text and how to recognize it. üßê <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ImOnlyFire/applications-bot/main/gibberish/defaults/bad.txt">Example</a>
       
        <b>Let's start with the first file. Just send me the text file containing the stuff I said in the first bullet point.</b>
    training_second_phase: |
        Seems good! Now please send the second file. 
    training_final_phase: |
        Good job! now please send the last file.
